## Semantic Commit Message
Every commit message should follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

1. **fix:**  a commit of the _type_ fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [**PATCH**](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
2. **feat:**  a commit of the _type_ feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [**MINOR**](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
3. **BREAKING CHANGE:**  a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [**MAJOR**](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
4. _types_ other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example [**@commitlint/config-conventional**](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the [**the Angular convention**](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
5. _footers_ other than BREAKING CHANGE: \&lt;description\&gt; may be provided and follow a convention similar to [**git trailer format**](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).
